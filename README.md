MyTrueRealty real estate website utilizing GatsbyJS, Styled Components library, and React Icons library to implement a static website. There are future plans
to incorporate drawing from the FresnoMLS API to dynamically display homes that fit a certain filter criteria by the end-user within an info card as well as map and icon placements. At that time, a different solution other than GatsbyJS will need to be researched in order to support more complex features and increased calls to the server.

For now, GatsbyJS fulfills a simple static website that will utilize buttons linked to predefined search results from the clients Fresno MLS account to displays homes. These buttons will relocate the end-user to a different website in which the search results appear.
